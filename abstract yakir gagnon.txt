Integrating Software Engineering and Sensory Ecology: Tools for Understanding Animal Orientation
Yakir Luc Gagnon, Lund University
At Professor Marie Dacke's lab in Lund University, I develop software that helps scientists uncover how dung beetles navigate using cues like the sun, moon, and even the Milky Way. These behaviors are studied through complex experiments that generate large datasets, and my role is to transform this raw information into meaningful insights. I design and maintain computational pipelines mostly in Julia, incorporating Bayesian statistical models and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to analyze orientation and behavioral data. To ensure reproducibility and collaboration, I use GitHub for version control and continuous integration, and I build modular, open-source tools for image analysis, trajectory reconstruction, and data visualization. By combining software engineering principles with advanced statistical modeling, I enable researchers to rigorously test hypotheses about sensory ecology and navigation strategies. This integration of coding and biology accelerates discovery and promotes transparent, scalable science.
